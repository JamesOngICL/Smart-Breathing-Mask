# Project by the Smart Team

It's a project for the 3rd Year EE Embedded Systems Module.

Project guide is available here: https://github.com/edstott/ES-CW1/blob/main/README.md

## Final Idea

Smart mask that can also be used as a wearable. It is good for doctors, they are our target customers, as well as people who live in very polluted areas, where air quality can vary a lot. 

It keeps track of their calories by measuring steps, (heart rate?), while also monitoring the surrounding air quality.
